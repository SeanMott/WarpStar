Available DSP emulation engines are HLE (High Level Emulation) and
LLE (Low Level Emulation). HLE is fast but often less accurate while LLE is
slow but close to perfect. Note that LLE has two submodes (Interpreter and
Recompiler), which cannot be selected from the command line.

Available video backends are "D3D" (only available on Windows) and
"OGL". There's also "Software Renderer", which uses the CPU for rendering and
is intended for debugging purposes only.
