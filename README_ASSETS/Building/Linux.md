# Building for Linux and macOS
Dolphin requires [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) for systems other than Windows. Many libraries are
bundled with Dolphin and used if they're not installed on your system. CMake
will inform you if a bundled library is used or if you need to install any
missing packages yourself.

### Linux Global Build Steps:

To install to your system.

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`
5. `sudo make install`

### Linux Local Build Steps:

Useful for development as root access is not required.

1. `mkdir Build`
2. `cd Build`
3. `cmake .. -DLINUX_LOCAL_DEV=true`
4. `make`
5. `ln -s ../../Data/Sys Binaries/`

### Linux Portable Build Steps:

Can be stored on external storage and used on different Linux systems.
Or useful for having multiple distinct Dolphin setups for testing/development/TAS.

1. `mkdir Build`
2. `cd Build`
3. `cmake .. -DLINUX_LOCAL_DEV=true`
4. `make`
5. `cp -r ../Data/Sys/ Binaries/`
6. `touch Binaries/portable.txt`
